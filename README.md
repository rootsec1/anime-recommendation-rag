Still trying to find a name

## Quickstart

1. Download [llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile](https://huggingface.co/Mozilla/llava-v1.5-7b-llamafile/resolve/main/llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile?download=true) (4.29 GB).

2. Open your computer's terminal.

3. If you're using macOS, Linux, or BSD, you'll need to grant permission
for your computer to execute this new file. (You only need to do this
once.)

```sh
chmod +x llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile
```

4. If you're on Windows, rename the file by adding ".exe" on the end.

5. Run the llamafile. e.g.:

```sh
./llava-v1.5-7b-q4.llamafile
```

6. Your browser should open automatically and display a chat interface.
(If it doesn't, just open your browser and point it at http://localhost:8080)

7. When you're done chatting, return to your terminal and hit
`Control-C` to shut down llamafile.
